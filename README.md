## Description

I build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I did to learn Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
I learn:  
    - how to use MongoDB database.      
    - Define the structure of the database with a Mongoose schema.    
    - how to execute CRUD queries using Mongoose..    
    - how to implement a Mongoose virtual property to create computed properties.         
    - how to use Moment to format a Date.
